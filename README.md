# Introduction: 
Climate change has become one of the most significant problems in recent years. It is not only a meteorologic problem but also an ecological, economic, political and humanistic issue. Substantial efforts have been made to analyze the trends and impacts of climate change and deal with a series of corresponding situations.

The prediction of weather has always been complicated. The process is subject to a huge number of factors and becomes really chaotic. However, the development of machine learning reveals a new possibility for us to solve such a problem. One the one hand, there is tons of weather data collected every second all over the world. We need to inspect this data to distinguish the trends of climate change in each specific region. This task can never be accomplished without the help of machine learning. On the other hand, the impacts of climate change exist across every aspect of our society and environment, but sometimes the relationships are hidden and we need to dig deep into the data to figure them out. 

Most of the previous research focuses on the ecological impacts of climate change which have more or less an evident relationship we can sense based on our knowledge. In our project, we will try to distinguish the impacts which may seem vague at first glance. We will employ different kinds of regression models to analyze several important aspects such as population density, disease rate, industry, agricultural output, etc. in order to demonstrate the huge influence that climate change has on us.
